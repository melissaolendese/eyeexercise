# Eye Exercise
Eye Exercise is a project that allows a set of eyes to follow your cusor movement.  This was a great coding assignment that allowed me to practice different CSS stylings and coding cusor movement for the first time!
## How to Run
Simply follow my link to open up the HTML file to watch those eyes follow you around.
